ZenOSS Usage
------------

As Zenoss deploys a bundled python version on which the system is tested and built against; often my python scripts will fail when using them natively with ZenOSS.

As such where applicable I have provided a service_name.sh file, this is a wrapper which unsets the relevant system env variables, and executes the check using the OS native python version.

If you can think of a better way of doing these i.e. zenpacks then by all means let me know I'd be more than happy to review them and make the required changes.

As IS
-----

I shouldn't have to mention all these checks are provided AS IS; I have only tested them so far as deploys I have done myself, if you run into problems, please raise an issue and I'll do my best to work on a fix.
